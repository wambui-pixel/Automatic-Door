 # COVID-19 PROJECT- Automatic Door System
 
 ## An Automatic Door Sytem prototype that uses an Ultrasonic sensor and a Servo motor

## Project Statement

The project involves coming up with a proof-of-concept automatic door system that helps reduce coming into contact with contaminated surfaces, e.g. a door in a public place, 
most especially during this day and age of Covid-19.
The door is automated in such a way that it opens once one comes within range of the Ultrasonic sensor.
